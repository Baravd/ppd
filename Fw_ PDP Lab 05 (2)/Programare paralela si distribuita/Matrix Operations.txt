Matrix Addition:

a[m, n] + b[m, n] = c[m, n]

Please note the sizes are the same (m rows and n columns).

for i=0;i<m;i++
	for j=0;j<n;j++
		c[i, j] = a[i, j] + b[i, j]
		
Complexity: O(n^2)
		
Matrix Multiplication:

a[m, k] * b[k, n] = c[m, n]

Please note the relations between the dimensions of the matrices!

for i=0;i<m;i++
	for j=0;j<n;j++
		c[i, j] = 0
		for l=0;l<k;l++
			c[i, j] += a[i, l] * b[l, j]

Complexity: O(n^3)
